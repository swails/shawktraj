shawktraj
=========

Bash-awk frontend for the "cpptraj" program from AmberTools


April Fools
===========

Indeed, this program is an April Fools' joke.  Don't get the wrong idea, though.
It really DOES work.  Give it a try :).

Known Bugs
==========

When writing to standard input, no cursor or text appears. This is unlikely to
ever be fixed.

The shawk is from Boston.
